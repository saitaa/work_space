# Import Flask modules
from flask import Flask, render_template


# Create an object named app


# Create a function named `index` which uses template file named `index.html`
# send three numbers as template variable to the app.py and assign route of no path (‘/’)



# calculate sum of them using inline function in app.py, then sent the result to the
# “number.hmtl” file and assign route of path (‘/total’).
# When the user comes directly “/total” path, “Since this is GET
# request, Total hasn’t been calculated” string returns to them with “number.html” file
# Add a statement to run the Flask application which can be debugged.
